                    <h2>About HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</h2>
                    <p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. It provides the structure for the content on the web. Here are some key points about HTML:
                        <ol>
                        <li><strong>HTML Elements</strong>: HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. They are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. These tags include elements such as "head", "title", "body", "header", "footer", "article", "section", "p", "div", "span", "img", "aside", "audio", "video", "ul", "ol", "li", and many others.</li>

                        <li><strong>Functionality</strong>: HTML elements can be used to denote structural semantics for text, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. Additionally, HTML can embed programs written in scripting languages like JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.</li>

                        <li><strong>Evolution</strong>: HTML has evolved over the years. After HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, the focus turned to making it easier for other working groups to extend XHTML. The W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2. However, the W3C membership later decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. 
                        This led to the development of XHTML 1.0 and XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages, calling it XHTML2.</li>

                    <h2>HTML Encoding</h2>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>URL Encoding</strong>: HTML provides URL encoding, which allows for the representation of non-standard letters and characters in browsers and plug-ins using hexadecimal values. The default character-set in HTML5 is UTF-8.</li>
                        <li><strong>Symbols and Entities</strong>: HTML also supports the use of symbols, characters, and entity codes. For example, the Plus or Minus Sign has its own HTML symbol, character, and entity codes, along with ASCII, CSS, and HEX values.</li>
                        </ul>
